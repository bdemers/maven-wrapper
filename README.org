* Introduction
This is a copy of the [[http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html][Gradle wrapper]] ported for use with [[http://maven.apache.org][Apache Maven]].
This fork provides the Maven wrapper feature as a Maven plugin for more flexible reuse/integration.

To run this build as an example run the 'mvnw' script at the root of this repo as you would normally run 'mvn'
For example if you typically run 

 : mvn clean install

Then you would now run (without a leading =./= for MS Windows)
 : ./mvnw clean install
	
Now that the plugin is installed in your Maven cache, you can integrate the wrapper with your existing or new Maven projects.


The wrapper will **always** your current Maven version.
A wrapper created with Maven 3.0.4 will request Maven 3.0.4 if it's not already installed on the user's machine.	

* Usage

** Integration
In the =build= section of your pom.xml, add the following :

 : <build>
 :   <plugins>
 :     <plugin>
 :       <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
 :       <artifactId>wrapper-maven-plugin</artifactId>
 :       <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
 :       <!--
 : 	 <configuration>
 :   <baseDistributionUrl>http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/</baseDistributionUrl>         
 :       </configuration>
 :       -->
 :     </plugin>
 :   </plugins>
 : </build>

As shown above an optional =baseDistributionUrl= setting can be provided as configuration parameter.

The default base distribution URL is https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/maven/apache-maven.

The download URL pattern is =<baseDistributionUrl>/<mavenVersion>/apache-maven-<mavenVersion>-bin.zip=.
	
** Generating the Maven wrapper
Run the following command to generate the wrapper and supporting files.

 : mvn wrapper:wrapper

The =mvnw= and =mwnw.bat= command wrappers are generated at the root of the project folder.
	
The =maven/wrapper= folder is generated with the relevant jar and properties file in the project directory.

** Maven goals
- =wrapper:wrapper= : Generates the Maven Command Wrapper for the current project.
- =wrapper:help= : Displays the Maven Wrapper plugin help.

You can now start using either the =mvnw= or =mvnw.bat= commands on any project without an existing maven installation!

** Sharing the plugin among developers
If possible, it's better to publish the Maven wrapper build artifact to your Corporate/Private Repository Manager, as this plugin is not available on Maven central.
